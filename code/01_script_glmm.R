# ============================================================
# EXERCISE: GLMM Exercise - `sleep` Data Set
# ============================================================

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# sleep dataset (built-in R dataset)
#
# This dataset contains measurements of increased sleep time
# after administering two different drugs.
#
# Structure:
# - 20 observations total
# - 10 subjects (each measured twice)
# - Paired / repeated-measures design
#
# Variables:
#   extra : Increase in hours of sleep compared to baseline
#   group : Indicates which drug was administered (factor with two levels ("1", "2"))
#   ID    : factor identifying each subject; Each subject appears once in each group
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Q1 – Visualization:
# Compare sleep increase ("extra") between the two drug groups.
#
# Goals:
# - Show individual-level responses
# - Highlight paired structure (same subject in both groups)
# - Use color to identify subjects
# - Connect observations from the same subject using lines

# Q2 - Model development:
#
# Goal:
#   Examine how drug administration affects sleep duration.
#
# Key considerations:
#   - Response variable (extra) is continuous
#   - Drug (group) represents the treatment of interest
#   - Subject ID represents repeated measurements on the same
#     individuals

# EXERCISE: GLMM Exercise - `grouseticks` Data Set
# ============================================================

library(lme4)
data("grouseticks")

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# grouseticks dataset (from lme4 package)
#
# This dataset contains counts of parasitic ticks
# collected from red grouse chicks across multiple years
# and locations in Scotland.
#
# Structure:
# - 403 observations
# - Repeated measurements across broods and years
# - Count data with hierarchical (nested) structure
#
# Variables:
#   TICKS : Number of ticks counted on a chick
#   YEAR  : Sampling year
#   HEIGHT: height above sea level (meters)
#   LOCATION : Sampling site (grouping variable)
#   INDEX : Observation-level identifier
#
# Key features of the dataset:
# - Response variable is count data
# - Observations are grouped by brood and year
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# Q1 – Visualization:
#
# Goal:
#   Examine the relationship between parasite load (ticks) at the brood level and height above sea level.
#
# Key considerations:
# - Calculate average tick counts for each brood
# - Plot mean ticks vs. height
# - Color points by sampling year

# Q2 – Model development:
#
# Goal:
#   Develop a model to examine the relationship between parasite load (ticks) at the brood level and height above sea level.
#
# Key considerations:
#   - Response variable (TICKS) is count
#   - HEIGHT represents the variable of interest
#   - BROOD represents a grouping factor of repeated measurements
#   - YEAR represents another grouping factor of repeated measurements
